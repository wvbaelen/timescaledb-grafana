## About

New York City is home to more than 8.3 million people. In this dashboard, we can monitor and analyze data from New Yorkâ€™s yellow cab taxis using TimescaleDB in order to identify ways to gain efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

## Getting Started

1. Start all services:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

2. Create a data directory and add the [NYC taxi data](https://docs.timescale.com/latest/tutorials/tutorial-hello-timescale)

3. Next create all tables in Timescaledb:

```
psql --u postgres -h localhost -d postgres < SQL/nyc_data.sql
```
